I consider myself an engineer who bridged data analytics and hands-on work. Before attending the University of Michigan, I had worked for 4 years as a yield data engineer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (tsmc) where I was trained to be an engineer who is able to drive technology insights and implement solutions.
